# mastermind
"The classic game of Mastermind is played on a tray on which the Mastermind conceals a code and the Guesser has 10 tries to guess it. The code is a sequence of 4 (or 6, sometimes more) pegs of different colors. Each guess is a corresponding sequence of 4 (or more) pegs of different colors. A guess is "correct" when the color of every peg in the guess exactly matches the corresponding peg in the Mastermind's code. ",
" ",
"After each guess by the Guesser, the Mastermind will give a score comprising black & white pegs, not arranged in any order: ",
" ",
"- Black peg == guess peg matches the color of a code peg in the same position. ",
" ",
"- White peg == guess peg matches the color of a code peg in another position. ",
" ",
"Create a function that takes two strings, code and guess as arguments, and returns the score in a dictionary. ",
" ",
"- The code and guess are strings of numeric digits ",
" ",
"- The color of the pegs are represented by numeric digits ",
" ",
"- no "peg" may be double-scored"
